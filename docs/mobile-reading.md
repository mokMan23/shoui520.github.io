The best app currently for reading on a mobile device is **Hoshi Reader**, which has both iOS and Android versions. The Android version has first-class support for e-ink devices.

## Android

Download Hoshi Reader [here](https://github.com/HuangAntimony/Hoshi-Reader-Android/releases) - it is currently only available as an .apk, so you would need to sideload it.  

1. Download the .apk file, then open your device's file manager and tap on the downloaded .apk.  
2. Allow the permission for the file manager app to install unknown apps if prompted.
3. Tap "Install" once permission is granted.

Open the app and you will see the "Import EPUB" button, this is how you'll import a book into Hoshi Reader.

This will open the file picker, select an EPUB file to import your book.  
![img](img/hoshireader_android_2.jpg){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }  
By default your books will appear as "Unshelved". The folder icon in the top-right is how you can manage your *Shelves*. This is useful for categorizing your books (plan to read, high priority, low priority, dropped, on hold, completed etc.)  

To set up the pop-up dictionary, go to *Settings* then "Dictionaries". To import from .zip, tap the + in the top-right corner. Hoshi Reader can automatically fetch the latest version of JMdict with the "Download Recommended Dictionaries" option.  
![img](img/hoshireader_android_3.jpg){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }  
Start reading by tapping on your imported book in *Books*.  

Tap on a word to trigger the pop-up dictionary.  
![img](img/hoshireader_android_4.jpg){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }  
You can adjust the appearance of the reader by tapping the settings button in the bottom-right corner. You can also adjust the size of the dictionary popup in this menu, at the bottom.  
![img](img/hoshireader_android_5.jpg){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }  
### Anki setup

This requires [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) to be installed.  

In Hoshi Reader, go to *Settings* → *Anki* → tap *Fetch* in AnkiDroid. Allow the permission when prompted.  

Then, choose the Anki deck.  
![img](img/hoshireader_android_6.jpg){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }  
The card type "Model" will automatically be configured for Lapis, which is the recommended card type. The fields will also be automatically configured. For most people, the Anki setup is complete at this point.  


You can then add Anki cards by opening a book, tapping a word to look it up then pressing the **+** button in the dictionary pop-up  

![img](img/hoshireader_android_7.jpg){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }  
### Local Audio

Note: the local audio database uses 5.79GB of space on your device. Please ensure your device has sufficient space to not be out of space when the local audio database is imported to your device.

Download: [android.db](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fn11_nN04zM89yKFYBWVTi0Xpaf6I3qe/view)  


Setting up local audio is easy. You just need to import the android.db file. 

Set it up: *Settings* → *Advanced* → *Audio* → Local Audio: Enable → tap "Import" and pick the `android.db` file.  
![img](img/hoshireader_android_8.jpg){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }  
Hoshi Reader will automatically add the *Local* source and prefer it over the default source(s).  

You are done!  
## iOS

Hoshi Reader for iOS is available directly from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/hoshi-reader/id6758244332) for devices on iOS 18 or later.

Open the app and you will see a plus in the top right corner. Press on it and it will open a file picker from which you can import your epub files.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_1.png){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

Additionally you can directly share books to Hoshi Reader when downloading books from e.g. Discord. Simply tap on *Open in Hoshi* or tap on more/the share button to choose Hoshi from the list of apps.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_2.png){: style="max-height: 400px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

Hoshi Reader does not include any dictionaries out of the box. Navigate to *Settings* → *Dictionaries* to import your own Yomitan dictionaries or download a set of recommended dictionaries (JMdict, JMnedict, Jiten) by pressing on the button. You can reorder dictionaries by dragging and delete dictionaries by swiping left.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_3.png){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

Open a book and tap on a word to look it up.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_4.png){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

You can configure the reader and popup to your liking by pressing on the context menu in the bottom right corner and choosing *Appearance*.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_5.png){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }
### Anki setup

Mining requires either the official, paid [AnkiMobile](https://apps.apple.com/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387) app or an AnkiConnect instance hosted from a PC.
#### AnkiMobile

In Hoshi Reader go to *Settings* → *Anki*. Press on *Fetch decks and models from Anki*. You will be redirected to AnkiMobile. AnkiMobile will ask whether you allow Hoshi Reader to request your decks and notetypes, press *OK*.

You should be redirected back to Hoshi Reader. Choose your Anki deck and notetype and fill out the fields for your notetype at the bottom, you can find a reference for Lapis [here](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis#how-to-use-lapis).

AnkiMobile does not provide a good way to check your collection for duplicates. You can however import a backup of your collection or deck to allow Hoshi Reader to check for duplicates.

To create a backup, open AnkiMobile and either tap on *Add/Export* → *Export Collection* in the bottom left corner, or swipe right on a deck and tap on *Export*, depending on the scope you want duplicates to be checked in. 

Untick *Include media* and press on *Export to Share Sheet*. You should be able to choose Hoshi Reader from the list of apps. Hoshi Reader will now check for duplicates in the deck/collection in that backup and automatically add words you mine to it as well. 

If you mine on any other devices, it's recommended to import a fresh backup periodically to make sure it stays in sync.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_6.png){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }
#### AnkiConnect

If you don't have access to AnkiMobile, you can alternatively use Anki and [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) from your PC.

To set this up first of all make sure you have AnkiConnect installed in Anki. In Anki navigate to *Tools* → *Add-ons*. Choose AnkiConnect and press on *Config* in the bottom right corner.

Change the `webBindAddress` to `0.0.0.0`. Restart Anki.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_7.png){: style="max-height: 700px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

You will need the local IPv4 address of your PC. To find your PC's IPv4 address you can open *Settings* → *Network & internet* → *Wi-Fi* or *Ethernet* depending on your connection on Windows, or *Settings* → *Wi-Fi* → *Details* on the connected network on macOS. Scroll down to find the IPv4 address (not the router/gateway address).

In Hoshi Reader navigate to *Settings* → *Advanced* → *AnkiConnect*. Tick *Use AnkiConnect* and type `http://localip:8765` into the address field.

Tap on *Connect*, you will be asked to allow Hoshi Reader to find devices on local networks. Tap *Allow* and tap on *Connect* again. A Windows Defender Firewall window may show up on your PC asking you to allow Anki to communicate on your local network. Press *Allow access*. If you aren't connected yet you may have to tap on *Connect* again. 

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_8.png){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

You can now follow the same steps to configure your deck and notetype in *Settings* → *Anki*. A backup is not needed when using AnkiConnect, duplicate checks will work out of the box. You will need to keep your PC on to mine cards.

Add a card to Anki by tapping the **+** button in the dictionary pop-up. If you're using AnkiMobile, this will briefly jump to AnkiMobile and then jump back to Hoshi Reader.

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_9.jpg){: style="max-height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

### Local Audio

Make sure you have around 13GB of space on your device during import.

Download: [android.db](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fn11_nN04zM89yKFYBWVTi0Xpaf6I3qe/view)

Navigate to *Settings* → *Advanced* → *Audio*. Scroll down to the bottom and enable Local Audio. Tap on *Import* and choose the *android.db*. The database is copied into app storage, so you can delete the copy from your Downloads folder (don't press on the delete button in the app).

![img](img/hoshireader_ios_10.png){: style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

Hoshi Reader will automatically add the *Local* source and prefer it over the default source(s).  

You are done!
